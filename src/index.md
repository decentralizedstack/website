## Principles

### We are the value

* **Private Sharing** creates value ecosystems: our information is private by default; when we share, this sharing should also be private by default.  This private sharing creates value networks within our own "walled gardens".
* Imagine **viral private sharing**, where we share a "group" or "federation" private key, which unlocks a whole body of content, viral in the sense that these keys are intended to be reshared, with each additional share increasing the reach and value of the content.
* **Semantic Currency** - our words, ideas and sensemaking are themselves the most valuable currency.

### The power is in our hands

* No central authority
* Vendor Relationship Management
* We own our data - accessed through Self Authentication

### Giant Global Graph

* Our personal graph server serves up our public and private content, either free or monetized 
* Omnicentric visual interfaces allow us to naturally explore connections
