## Principles

### You are the value

* Private by default - creating value networks within our own flexible "walled gardens"
* Viral Private Sharing - sharing a "group" or "federation" private key, which unlocks a whole body of content, and is intended to be reshared
* Semantic Currency - our words and ideas and sensemaking is itself the most valuable currency

### The power is in your hands

* No central authority
* Vendor Relationship Management
* You own your data - accessed through Self Authentication

### Giant Global Graph

* Your personal graph server serves up your public and private content, either free or monetized 
* Omnicentric visual interfaces allow you to naturally explore connections
