### Introduction  
The proliferation of social networking platforms has led to massively centralized data silos which exploit people's personal information for the monetary gain of platform owners. At the same time, digital identities are fragmented as they are spread out across multiple platforms, resulting in a poor user experience which either leads to bad security practices (poor password choices), sign-on friction (need for a password manager), or breaches of privacy (social sign-on). Attempts have been made to decentralize social networking, but all have failed compared to the successes of incumbent networks due to poor user experiences. By contrast, the Last Social Network will use a combination of new and existing protocols and applications to redecentralize the web while maintaining the high-quality experience people have come to expect. This technology will give users control of their digital identity and personal data so they may interact with each other as peers on the global Internet, empowering them to retain their privacy and the value they produce online.
