# Introduction  
The proliferation of social networking platforms has led to massively centralized data silos which exploit people's personal information for the monetary gain of platform owners. Digital identities are fragmented as they are spread out across multiple platforms, resulting in a poor user experience which either leads to bad security practices (poor password choices), sign-on friction (need for a password manager), or breaches of privacy (social sign-on). Attempts have been made to decentralize social networking, but all have failed compared to the successes of incumbent networks due to poor user experiences (among other issues) [1]. By contrast, the Last Social Network will use a combination of new and existing protocols and applications to redecentralize the web while maintaining the high-quality experience people have come to expect. This technology will give users control of their digital identity and personal data so they may interact with each other as peers on the global Internet, empowering them to retain their privacy and the value they produce online.

# Design Philosophy  
The Last Social Network (LSN) is not intended to be yet-another social networking app, but rather the underlying plumbing which connects apps together. This philosophy is guided by the realization that the Internet itself is a social network, albeit one governed by protocols which have trended towards centralization rather than decentralization. By creating a generalized framework and providing only the basic components that others can build on, we ensure an open ecosystem that gives app developers complete freedom to build while ensuring that user autonomy is respected in the process. To align incentives for the participation of all stakeholders in the ecosystem, monetization mechanisms will be native to the LSN, enabling app developers, data producers, and data consumers to partake in a frictionless information economy. The LSN will serve as a basis for "Web 3.0" platforms that put users, rather than "the Stacks", at the center of the network [2][3]. 

# The Components  

##Identity  
Identity is at the core of the network. Without identity under the control of the users, they will just be forced back into another system where third parties dictate the terms of their participation in the network. The LSN will incorporate only those identity technologies which a) give users full control while b) preserving a familiar and high-quality user experience.

###OpenName  
The OpenName protocol is a "decentralized name, identity, and auth protocol built on Bitcoin technology" [4]. Combining public/private key cryptography with a distributed ledger and transaction processing system allows the OpenName protocol to satisfy the needs for a digital identity that is at the same time a) secure b) decentralized and c) human-readable [5]. This satisfies the requirement that users have full control while preserving a familiar and high-quality user experience.
